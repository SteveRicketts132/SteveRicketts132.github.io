 This website shamelesses steals from the more famous motorcycle diaries of Che Guevara to get some more hits.  Unlike the more famous diaries this does not end up in revolution in Cuba, but allows me to share my adventures with you. As I have gotten older and possibly wiser, my son has become semi independent and so I am able to indulge my two passions of motorcycling and travel and I have catelogued them here.  This website is an odd one as it does not aim to sell you anything and exists as my son wished to write a website in the coronavirus lockdown (blame him for IT gliches N.b It is also still being built so will evolve with time). Hope you enjoy!! </p>
