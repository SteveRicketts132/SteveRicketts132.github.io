			The first impression is traffic chaos and the reason we did not collect our motorcycles from the hotel. But we driven to what looked like a parade ground outside the city. In the centre of the city is a large lake, where the remains of a B52 lie. There is also temple in the lake.
			It is a very lively city, where you can buy first class Rolex copies, if first class copy is not a contradiction in terms. If this is your thing and it was for Lars. He bought 2 for $200 and spent the rest of the trip failing to buy some more.So if first class copies of Rolexes is your thing, buy all the ones you want in Hanoi before you leave test.

			Throughout Vietnam the motorcycle is generally the Minsk either the boxer twin copied from a pre war BMW or a smaller single motorcycle.
			The story goes that after the first tour, the Minsks proved so unreliable that Kurt told Gnoc he had to buy some new motorcycles. Gnoc replied he would need $7 000 to buy new motorcycles. Obviously Kurt lent Gnoc the money.The Honda 250 XL proved ideal and reliable.

			Scooter / mopeds
			Japanese or Chinese scooters are everywhere. Merge and weave, generally gives way to  who dares wins.
			Whereas we think of a moped as a single person runaround, the Vietnamese think MPV. Five people on a scooter is the norm, with a small baby peering over the handlebars and 2 kids sandwiched between dad and mum.
			To see 3 pigs rolled in leaves and strapped to the pillion seat is common, as is a wardrobe or fridge-freezer. Hanging from the pillion peg.
