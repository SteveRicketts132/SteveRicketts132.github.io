			<b>Hue - The Former Imperialist Capital</b> 
		</p>
		<p class ="paragraph colpara1" style="text-indent: 5%">
			Hue is the former Imperial capital. Gnoc says the North Vietnamese Army captured the citadel in the Tet Offensive. The gates are scared by shells holes.
			Here the French influence is strongest. You can get baguettes. But don’t ,ention the French.they seem to have upset the Vietnamese more than the Fench. It actually nice to be a nation less despised for once.
			The River is referred to as the Perfume River due to Joss sticks being burned along its bank. Dragon Boats, made from the steel that the American lined their runways with, sail up and down to the residing placed of the Emperors.
			One of the best theme bars I have been to is the DMZ, in Hue. The seats are oil drums and the lights are shaped light bombs. They play sixties music, to add to the atmosphere.

			<b>Food-Tasty</b>
		</p>

		<p class="paragraph colpara2" style="text-indent: 5%">
			From Hanoi to Hue we ate what we were given with chopsticks, no other cutlery was offered. It was mostly food that got trapped in your teeth and you spend the morning journey trying to get it out with your tongue. Having succeeded by lunchtime, when you ate lunch and spend the afternoon using your tongue again. Then there was dinner.
			There wasn’t any food stops along the Western Ho Chi Minh Trail, until we came to a shop. In the corner was a monkey in a small cage. Gnoc was obviously waiting for a comment, when a member of the tour said something, he lunched into “ You western people are quick to judge us. These man is a ranger and he has recued the monkey from the villagers, He has tried to release the monkey, but it keeps coming back.”
			The ranger’s mother said something to Gnoc in Vietnamese. Gnoc translated it “We let the monkey out twice a week and it shits in the kitchen”
			We had chicken noodle soup with a duck egg in it.

			<b> Climate - Hot</b>
		<p class="paragraph colpara1" style="text-indent: 5%">
			Allegedly “It's hot! Damn hot! Real hot! Hottest things is my shorts. I could cook things in it.”
			But on my trip it rained from Hanoi to Tan Ky and of course in Khe San, but that just added to the depressive atmosphere of the place.
			Gnoc liked his motorcycles shiny, so we were sent to the jet wash. The lady operative got carried away and jet washed us.
			This was fine, but I have developed the minimalist approach to foreign travel meaning one pair of motorcycle jeans, 3 pairs of socks, pants and t shirts, and a down jacket. Hence our hotel was the one with the jeans hanging out the window trying to dry.

			<b> People</b>
		<p class="paragraph colpara2" style="text-indent: 5%">
			I checked out this tour company who I spoke to 2 years running at the NEC in Birmingham. Only when I go to Hanoi Airport did I realize it was a Danish company brilliantly run by Kurt.I roomed with Lars, who spoke perfect unaccented English, although he had never been to the UK. He learned English by watching Fawty Towers, but never mentioned the War. It was the year Leicester City won the Premiership, so I taught him “Leicester, we’re not shit any more!”The Vietnamese element was organized by Gnoc, who was born in a cave, while the B52 pounded Hanoi.Chi actually led the tour from the front. His claim to fame was he can change a piston in a Minsk in 30 minutes. Which explains why we were riding Hondas!So the comment “It's very difficult to find a Vietnamese man named Charlie. They're all named Nyugen or Doh or things like that. “ Is true.
